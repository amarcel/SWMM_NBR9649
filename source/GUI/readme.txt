CONTENTS OF SWMM51012_GUI.ZIP
=============================

This archive contains source code for the Windows graphical user
interface portion of Version 5.1.012 of the Storm Water Management
Model (SWMM). The interface was written using Embarcadero's Delphi
XE2 (www.embarcadero.com). The name of the Delphi project containing
the code is Epaswmm5. All of the files for the project can be found
in the GUI5_1_012.ZIP file within this archive.

Before the Epaswmm5 project can be loaded into Delphi's Integrated
Development Environment (IDE), several special components must be
installed into the IDE's component pallette. The source code for
these components is contained in the COMPONENTS.ZIP file in this
archive. Consult the Delphi Users Guide for instructions on how to
install these components.
